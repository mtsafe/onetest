      <p>Hi&#33; My name is Mary Williams, and I am the Founder and Head Coach for One Test at a Time. I have been a
        Type 1 Diabetic for nearly three decades. I was diagnosed on Labor Day, September 5, 1993. At the young age of
        10, I was forced to grow up faster than most children. I remember bits and pieces of the day I was rushed to the
        hospital. My blood sugar was 750, my body was going into Diabetic Ketoacidosis, and I was slipping into a coma.
        I was dying. Thankfully, after 3 days in the ICU, I woke up and unaware of the life changes I was about to face.
      </p>
      <p>Starting on an Exchange Diet and taking Humulin R and Humulin NPH forced me to eat only at specific times and I
        had to follow a strict diet. After a few years with medical advances, my doctor switched me to a carb counting
        diet and I was able to take a better fast acting insulin called Humalog. After the turn of a new millennia, I
        was then able to take a better long acting insulin called Lantus. I am now taking insulin that works well for
        me, Novolog for my fast acting insulin and Tresiba for my long acting insulin.</p>
      <p>I have used manual injections, insulin pumps, glucometers, and continuous glucose meters to help manage my Type
        1 Diabetes. I have had severe lows that have sent me to the hospital or caused a team of EMTs to show up at my
        house filling my veins with dextrose. I have been to the hospital four times in one year because the insulin I
        was using was not working and causing me to go into Diabetic Ketoacidosis. In my teenage years, as well as in my
        mid-20's, I dealt with Diabulimia, an eating disorder where you use your high blood sugars as a method of losing
        weight. And with every obstacle, I have risen above and proved I can handle what this disease decides to throw
        at me. After years of studying this disease, learning about new innovations and scientific measures, and
        experiencing the highs and lows that Diabetes can put you through I decided to start my own Diabetic Coaching
        gig One Test at a Time.</p>
      <p>My goal with starting One Test at a Time is to use my own experiences and the research that is currently out
        there to help motivate, inspire, and educate people who are diagnosed with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. But my
        coaching does not just stop there. Those who have Gestational Diabetes or LADA &#40;Latent Autoimmune Diabetes
        in Adults&#41; are also welcomed to use my coaching services. Because no matter what type of Diabetes you have,
        the frustrations are all the same. I am here to help you overcome those frustrations, defeat the burn-out, and
        help you communicate more effectively with your doctor on your Diabetes treatment plan.</p>
